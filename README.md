#CrestScribe

A background processing worker to fetch ESI data (originally CREST).
It also handles the refresh of access tokens.

This C# application was originally a Windows service but now ported to .NET 8 so it can run cross platform.

This is used by siggy to fetch character locations.

This thing is horribly written and awful. 
Use at your own desire.

##Requirements

* Visual Studio 2022
* MySQL
* .NET 8
