#CrestScribe

A EVE Online CREST  service worker that copies down data from CREST for later usage. The target usage is retrieving character location data.

This C# application is meant to run as a Windows service that performs its job in the background.

This is used by siggy to fetch character locations.

This thing is horribly written and awful. Use at your own desire.

##Requirements

* Visual Studio 2015
* MySQL
* .NET Framework 4.5.2
